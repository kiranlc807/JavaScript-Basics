forEach():
----------
* the forEach() function receives function as an argument.
* it applies the some code to every element.
* it will not return anything.
* it just applies the condition to every element.
* it will not change the Original Array.

syntax:
        forEach((element)=> { code logic })
        forEach((element,index)=>{ code logic})


Difference Between map(), forEch() and filter():-
-----------------------------------------------------
* map() will return a new array as per the condition applied.
* forEach() will not return anything [undefined].
* filter() will return an array of condition satisfies element or an empty array.
-------
* if we have a requirment to modifiy the current array and are experting a modified one, 
  then we should go with map().
* if we just want to iterate the array, then we can use forEach().
* if we are experting filterd values from a given array then we should use filter().
