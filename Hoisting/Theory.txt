Hoisting:-
----------
* Hoisting is a behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their 
  containing scope during the compilation phase.

NOTE:
    * Only the declarations hoists not the intialization.

* Only the var declarations can only hoists to top not let , const
* because they are Block Scope that means before using they has to declare.
Ex:
    1.var 
        console.log(a) //undefined
        var a = 10
        console.log(a) //10
    
    2.let and const
        console.log(a) // Cannot access 'a' before initialization
        let a=10

* function expressions are not Hoisting 
Ex: 
    foo(); // TypeError: foo is not a function
    var foo = function() {
    console.log("Hello, not hoisted!");
}
