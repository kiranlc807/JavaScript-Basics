.evn [environment variables]
-----------------------------
* .env file is a configuration file used to store environment variables for your application.

* Environment variables are key-value pairs that contain various settings and configuration values
  needed by your Node.js application.

* These variables can include database connection strings, API keys, port numbers, and other sensitive information.

Ex:
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_PORT=5432
    API_KEY=your_api_key

-> To use the values stored in the .env file within your Node.js application, you would typically use
   a package like dotenv.
-> This package reads the .env file and loads the variables into the process.env object, making them accessible in your code
 
how to use dotenv in a Node.js application:
--------------------------------------------------
    1.Install dotenv using npm or yarn:
        >npm install dotenv


    2.Require and configure dotenv at the top of your application file:

        require('dotenv').config();


    3.Now, you can access your environment variables using process.env:

        const dbHost = process.env.DB_HOST;
        const dbPort = process.env.DB_PORT;
        const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;

        console.log(`Database Host: ${dbHost}`);
        console.log(`Database Port: ${dbPort}`);
        console.log(`API Key: ${apiKey}`);
