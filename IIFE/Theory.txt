IIFE-> [Immediately Invoked Function Expression]
-------------------------------------------------
* It is a design pattern where a function is defined and executed immediately after its creation.

* This pattern is often used to create a private scope for variables, preventing them from polluting 
   the global scope.

   EX:
        (function() {
            // Your code here
        })();

* This creates an anonymous function and immediately invokes it.

* Anything declared inside this function is within its own scope and doesn't affect the outside scope.

* IIFE is commonly used to avoid naming conflicts, encapsulate code, and manage variable scope efficiently.
