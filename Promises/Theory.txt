What is a promise in JavaScript?
----------------------------------
A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.


syntax:-
-------------
            let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
                            //do something
                            });

Parameters
------------
* The promise constructor takes only one argument which is a callback function

* The callback function takes two arguments, resolve and reject

* Perform operations inside the callback function and if everything went well then call resolve.
   If desired operations do not go well then call reject.


Promise Consumers: 
    * Promises can be consumed by registering functions using .then and .catch methods.

    promise. then(success). catch(error) is that in case if success callback returns a rejected promise,
    then only the second form is going to catch that rejection.
