Closure:
---------
* A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state 
  (the lexical environment). In other words

* A closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function.

Ex:
    function init() {
    var name = "Mozilla"; // name is a local variable created by init

    function displayName() {

    // displayName() is the inner function, that forms the closure
    
    console.log(name); // use variable declared in the parent function
    }
    displayName();
    }
    init();
