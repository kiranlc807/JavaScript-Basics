JWT:
-----
* A JSON web token(JWT) is JSON Object which is used to securely transfer information over the web
  (between two parties). 

  ex:
        xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz

        x->header
        y->payload
        z->signature

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) consist of three main parts: 
-------------------------------------------------
1.Header:
---------
* The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token, which is JWT, and the signing algorithm 
 being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA.

2.Payload:
----------
* The second part of the JWT is the payload, which contains the claims. Claims are statements about an 
 entity (typically, the user) and additional data.

3.Signature:
------------
* The signature is used to verify the integrity of the token. It is created by hashing the header and payload 
  using the secret key.
